# New Relic Server Monitor configuration file.
#
# Lines that begin with a # are comment lines and are ignored by the server
# monitor. For those options that have command line equivalents, if the
# option is specified on the command line it will over-ride any value set
# in this file.
#

#
# Option : license_key
# Value  : 40-character hexadecimal string provided by New Relic. This is
#          required in order for the server monitor to start.
# Default: none
#
license_key=<%= node["newrelic-sysmond"]["license_key"] %>

#
# Option : loglevel
# Value  : Level of detail you want in the log file (as defined by the logfile
#          setting below. Valid values are (in increasing levels of verbosity):
#          error        - show errors only
#          warning      - show errors and warnings
#          info         - show minimal additional information messages
#          verbose      - show more detailed information messages
#          debug        - show debug messages
#          verbosedebug - show very detailed debug messages
# Default: error
# Note   : Can also be set with the -d command line option.
#
loglevel=<%= node["newrelic-sysmond"]["loglevel"] %>

#
# Option : logfile
# Value  : Name of the file where the server monitor will store it's log
#          messages. The amount of detail stored in this file is controlled
#          by the loglevel option (above).
# Default: none. However it is highly recommended you set a value for this.
# Note   : Can also be set with the -l command line option.
#
logfile=<%= node["newrelic-sysmond"]["logfile"] %>

#
# Option : proxy
# Value  : The name and optional login credentials of the proxy server to use
#          for all communication with the New Relic collector. In its simplest
#          form this setting is just a hostname[:port] setting. The default
#          port if none is specified is 1080. If your proxy requires a user
#          name, use the syntax user@host[:port]. If it also requires a
#          password use the format user:password@host[:port]. For example:
#            fred:secret@proxy.mydomain.com:8181
# Default: none (use a direct connection)
#
<% if !node["newrelic-sysmond"]["proxy"].empty? %>
proxy=<%= node["newrelic-sysmond"]["proxy"] %>

#
# Setting: ssl
# Type   : boolean
# Purpose: If you prefer the daemon to use the secure HTTP (https) protocol
#          when communicating with the New Relic collector servers, set this
#          to true.
# Default: true (as of version 1.4)
#
ssl=<%= node["newrelic-sysmond"]["ssl"] %>

#
# Setting: ssl_ca_bundle
# Type   : string
# Purpose: Sets the location of a file containing CA certificates in PEM
#          format. When set, the certificates in this file will be used
#          to authenticate the New Relic collector servers. If ssl_ca_path
#          is also set (see below), the certificates in this file will be
#          searched first, followed by the certificates contained in the
#          ssl_ca_path directory. This setting has no effect when ssl
#          is set to false.
# Default: none
# Note   : Can also be set with the -b command line option.
#

ssl_ca_bundle=<%= node["newrelic-sysmond"]["ssl_ca_bundle"] %>
<% end %>

#
# Setting: ssl_ca_path
# Type   : string
# Purpose: Sets the location of a directory containing trusted CA certificates
#          in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this directory will be
#          used to authenticate the New Relic collector servers. If
#          ssl_ca_bundle is also set (see above), it will be searched first
#          followed by the certificates contained in ssl_ca_path. This
#          setting has no effect when ssl is set to false.
# Default: none
# Note   : Can also be set with the -S command line option.

#
# Option : pidfile
# Value  : Name of a file where the server monitoring daemon will store it's
#          process ID (PID). This is used by the startup and shutdown script
#          to determine if the monitor is already running, and to start it up
#          or shut it down.
# Default: /tmp/nrsysmond.pid
# Note   : Can also be set with the -p command line option.
#
<% if !node["newrelic-sysmond"]["pidfile"].empty? %>
pidfile=<%= node["newrelic-sysmond"]["pidfile"] %>
<% end %>

#
# Option : collector_host
# Value  : The name of the New Relic collector to connect to. This should only
#          ever be changed on advise from a New Relic support staff member.
#          The format is host[:port]. Using a port number of 0 means the default
#          port, which is 80 (if not using the ssl option - see below) or 443
#          if SSL is enabled. If the port is omitted the default value is used.
# Default: collector.newrelic.com
#
collector_host=<%= node["newrelic-sysmond"]["collector_host"] %>

#
# Option : timeout
# Value  : How long the monitor should wait to contact the collector host. If
#          the connection cannot be established in this period of time, the
#          monitor will progressively back off in 15-second increments, up to
#          a maximum of 300 seconds. Once the initial connection has been
#          established, this value is reset back to the value specified here
#          (or the default). This then sets the maximum time to wait for
#          a connection to the collector to report data. There is no back-off
#          once the original connection has been made. The value is in seconds.
# Default: 30
#
timeout=<%= node["newrelic-sysmond"]["timeout"] %>

#
# Option : hostname
# Value  : If you do not want to change the hostname at the OS level, you can
#          modify the nrsysmond.cfg file to contain a new hostname=
#          configuration setting that reports a different default server name.
#
#          Caution: The New Relic user interface uses the hostname to link
#          monitored applications to the server they are running on. Using the
#          hostname= configuration setting in the nrsysmond.cfg file may cause a
#          different name to be reported for the server than what is reported by
#          any monitored applications. This difference may cause the linkage
#          between the application and the server in the New Relic user
#          interface to break.
#
#          Additionally, be aware that using the hostname= configuration setting
#          in the nrsysmond.cfg file explicitly overrides reporting of the OS
#          level hostname in the server monitor. Any subsequent update to the OS
#          level hostname will be reflected only in the monitored application in
#          the New Relic user interface. This difference may cause the linkage
#          between the application and the server in the New Relic user
#          interface to break.
# Default: OS hostname
#

# Option : labels
# Value  : A series of label_type/label_value pairings
#          Each item in the pair is separated by a colon
#          Each pair is separated by a semicolon
#          e.g.
#            labels = Environment:Production;DataCenter:EastUS;
# Default: none
