# New Relic Server Monitor configuration file.
#
# Lines that begin with a # are comment lines and are ignored by the server
# monitor. For those options that have command line equivalents, if the
# option is specified on the command line it will over-ride any value set
# in this file.
#

#
# Option : license_key
# Value  : 40-character hexadecimal string provided by New Relic. This is
#          required in order for the server monitor to start.
# Default: none
#
license_key=<%= node["new_relic"]["license_key"] %>

#
# Option : loglevel
# Value  : Level of detail you want in the log file (as defined by the logfile
#          setting below. Valid values are (in increasing levels of verbosity):
#          error        - show errors only
#          warning      - show errors and warnings
#          info         - show minimal additional information messages
#          verbose      - show more detailed information messages
#          debug        - show debug messages
#          verbosedebug - show very detailed debug messages
# Default: error
# Note   : Can also be set with the -d command line option.
#
loglevel=<%= node["new_relic"]["loglevel"] %>

#
# Option : logfile
# Value  : Name of the file where the server monitor will store it's log
#          messages. The amount of detail stored in this file is controlled
#          by the loglevel option (above).
# Default: none. However it is highly recommended you set a value for this.
# Note   : Can also be set with the -l command line option.
#
logfile=<%= node["new_relic"]["logfile"] %>

#
# Option : proxy
# Value  : The name and optional login credentials of the proxy server to use
#          for all communication with the New Relic collector. In its simplest
#          form this setting is just a hostname["port"] setting. The default
#          port if none is specified is 1080. If your proxy requires a user
#          name, use the syntax user@host["port"]. If it also requires a
#          password use the format user:password@host["port"]. For example:
#            fred:secret@proxy.mydomain.com:8181
# Default: none (use a direct connection)
#
<% if !node["new_relic"]["proxy"].empty? %>
proxy=<%= node["new_relic"]["proxy"] %>
<% end %>

#
# Option : ssl
# Value  : Whether or not to use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for all
#          communication with the New Relic collector. Possible values are
#          true/on or false/off. In certain rare cases you may need to modify
#          the SSL certificates settings below.
# Default: false
#
ssl=<%= node["new_relic"]["ssl"] %>

#
# Option : ssl_ca_bundle
# Value  : The name of a PEM-encoded Certificate Authority (CA) bundle to use
#          for SSL connections. This very rarely needs to be set. The monitor
#          will attempt to find the bundle in the most common locations. If
#          you need to use SSL and the monitor is unable to locate a CA bundle
#          then either set this value or the ssl_ca_path option below.
# Default: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt or
#          /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
# Note   : Can also be set with the -b command line option.
#
<% if !node["new_relic"]["ssl_ca_bundle"].empty? %>
ssl_ca_bundle=<%= node["new_relic"]["ssl_ca_bundle"] %>
<% end %>

#
# Option : ssl_ca_path
# Value  : If your SSL installation does not use CA bundles, but rather has a
#          directory with PEM-encoded Certificate Authority files, set this
#          option to the name of the directory that contains all the CA files.
# Default: /etc/ssl/certs
# Note   : Can also be set with the -S command line option.
#
<% if !node["new_relic"]["ssl_ca_path"].empty? %>
ssl_ca_path=<%= node["new_relic"]["ssl_ca_path"] %>
<% end %>

#
# Option : pidfile
# Value  : Name of a file where the server monitoring daemon will store it's
#          process ID (PID). This is used by the startup and shutdown script
#          to determine if the monitor is already running, and to start it up
#          or shut it down.
# Default: /tmp/nrsysmond.pid
# Note   : Can also be set with the -p command line option.
#
<% if !node["new_relic"]["pidfile"].empty? %>
pidfile=<%= node["new_relic"]["pidfile"] %>
<% end %>

#
# Option : collector_host
# Value  : The name of the New Relic collector to connect to. This should only
#          ever be changed on advise from a New Relic support staff member.
#          The format is host["port"]. Using a port number of 0 means the default
#          port, which is 80 (if not using the ssl option - see below) or 443
#          if SSL is enabled. If the port is omitted the default value is used.
# Default: collector.newrelic.com
#
collector_host=<%= node["new_relic"]["collector_host"] %>

#
# Option : timeout
# Value  : How long the monitor should wait to contact the collector host. If
#          the connection cannot be established in this period of time, the
#          monitor will progressively back off in 15-second increments, up to
#          a maximum of 300 seconds. Once the initial connection has been
#          established, this value is reset back to the value specified here
#          (or the default). This then sets the maximum time to wait for
#          a connection to the collector to report data. There is no back-off
#          once the original connection has been made. The value is in seconds.
# Default: 30
#
timeout=<%= node["new_relic"]["timeout"] %>

#
# Option : hostname
# Value  : If you do not want to change the hostname at the OS level, you can
#          modify the nrsysmond.cfg file to contain a new hostname=
#          configuration setting that reports a different default server name.
#
#          Caution: The New Relic user interface uses the hostname to link
#          monitored applications to the server they are running on. Using the
#          hostname= configuration setting in the nrsysmond.cfg file may cause a
#          different name to be reported for the server than what is reported by
#          any monitored applications. This difference may cause the linkage
#          between the application and the server in the New Relic user
#          interface to break.
#
#          Additionally, be aware that using the hostname= configuration setting
#          in the nrsysmond.cfg file explicitly overrides reporting of the OS
#          level hostname in the server monitor. Any subsequent update to the OS
#          level hostname will be reflected only in the monitored application in
#          the New Relic user interface. This difference may cause the linkage
#          between the application and the server in the New Relic user
#          interface to break.
# Default: OS hostname
#
<% unless node["new_relic"]["hostname"].empty? -%>
hostname=<%= node["new_relic"]["hostname"] %>

#
# Option : labels
# Value  : A series of label_type/label_value pairings
#          Each item in the pair is separated by a colon
#          Each pair is separated by a semicolon
#          e.g. 
#            labels = Environment:Production;DataCenter:EastUS;
# Default: none
